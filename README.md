# Flask REST API

This project is a REST API built using Flask, designed for secure and efficient data handling with seamless database migrations. It integrates JWT-based authentication, object-relational mapping with SQLAlchemy, data serialization/deserialization with Marshmallow, and containerization with Docker.

## Technologies Used

- **Flask**: Lightweight Python web framework for building the API.
- **SQLAlchemy**: ORM (Object Relational Mapper) for database modeling and queries.
- **Marshmallow**: Library for object serialization and validation.
- **Flask-Migrate**: Extension for handling database migrations using Alembic.
- **Alembic**: Database migration tool integrated with SQLAlchemy.
- **JWT Authentication**: JSON Web Tokens for secure user authentication.
- **Docker**: Containerization for environment consistency and easier deployment.

## Project Features

- **JWT Authentication**: Secure API endpoints with JSON Web Tokens for user authentication and authorization.
- **SQLAlchemy ORM**: Database models and relationships managed via SQLAlchemy.
- **Data Validation with Marshmallow**: All incoming and outgoing data is validated and serialized with Marshmallow schemas.
- **Database Migrations**: Manage database versioning and migrations using Flask-Migrate and Alembic.
- **Dockerized Setup**: The API is containerized for easier deployment and environment consistency across development, testing, and production.
